# Concept Row Scroll System

Hey ðŸ‘‹ This is a little functionality concept I imagined and quickly built out.  
Iâ€™ve always enjoyed creating interactive and smooth UI components, so this project is my take on a scroll-based row system with fluid, engaging interactions.  

Itâ€™s just an experiment for now, but I had a lot of fun putting it together. ðŸš€
